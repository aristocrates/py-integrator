"""
Encapsulation of problems that can be expressed by a system of coupled
first order (in time) ordinary differential equations.

To create a class which extends Problem, and which encapsulates the
details of the equations and variables, note that there should be an
equation for each of the n_vars variables, and the initial data should
have length (n_vars + 1) (the last index is time).

Equations with explicit dependence on time have not been tested, but
should work with all provided integration methods.
